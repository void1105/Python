# 🐍 Python for AI: My 12-Hour Journey

Welcome! I am a 13-year-old aspiring **AI Engineer**. This repository is a dedicated space where I document my progress as I master Python fundamentals through the 12-hour Bro Code curriculum.

## 🎯 The Mission
My goal is to build a rock-solid foundation in Python logic. I believe that to build great Artificial Intelligence, you first have to understand the "brain" of the code—loops, data structures, and algorithms.

## 📂 Repository Structure
I’ve organized my work to show both the theory and the application:

* **[/projects](./Projects):** Full-scale functional programs, games, and tools.
* **[/notes](./Notes):** Daily exercises, syntax practice, and logical experiments.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Environment:** macOS / VS Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

*“Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.”*
