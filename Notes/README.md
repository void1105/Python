# 📓 Learning Notes & Exercises
This folder serves as my "Digital Lab." It contains the experiments, syntax tests, and logic exercises I complete while working through the Python curriculum.

### 🧠 What's in here:
- Explorations of Python's core data structures and logic.
- Practice scripts focusing on writing clean, efficient code.
- "Proof-of-concept" files for AI-related math and data handling.

*These files document the "learning by doing" phase of my journey into Artificial Intelligence.*
