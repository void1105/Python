# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python repository! I'm 13 years old and I'm learning Python as the first step toward a career in **Artificial Intelligence**.

## 📺 Course Progress
I am currently working through the **Bro Code 12-Hour Python Course**. My goal is to master the fundamentals before moving into AI libraries like NumPy and PyTorch.
