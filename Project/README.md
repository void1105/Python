# 🚀 Python Projects
This directory houses my functional Python applications. Each program here represents a milestone in my ability to take a real-world problem and solve it with code.

### 🛠️ Key Areas of Focus:
- **Interactive Logic:** Developing games and tools that respond to user input.
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Building calculators that automate complex formulas.
- **Data Management:** Creating programs that handle lists, dictionaries, and user data.

**The Goal:** Mastering the "Logic Layer" of programming so I can eventually build and deploy AI models that solve real-world problems.
